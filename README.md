**Languages**

- Check out my `ROS2` package for [connection with the Tobii Glasses Pro 2](https://github.com/enunezs/ros2_tobii_glasses2)

-  `Python`, for data processing and [machine vision](https://github.com/enunezs/AppleCounting).
-  `C++`, `C` and a *bit* of `assembly` for [robots](https://github.com/tinyAtlas/Dynamic-Recalibration-of-the-Odometry), microcontrollers and processors.
-  `Matlab` and `Simulink`, symbolic and optimization toolboxes for research applications, robotics and control systems

**Fav. Projects:**
